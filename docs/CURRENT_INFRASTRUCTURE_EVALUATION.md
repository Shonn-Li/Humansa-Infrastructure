# Humansa Infrastructure Evaluation

## Current Configuration Overview

### What You're Building
- **Purpose**: ML API Server for Chinese users
- **Scale**: 300-400 concurrent requests (not 300k!)
- **Region**: Hong Kong (ap-east-1)
- **Architecture**: Simple API server, no frontend

### Current Infrastructure Components

#### 1. Network Architecture ‚ùå OVER-ENGINEERED
```
Current:
- VPC with public + private subnets
- 2 NAT Gateways ($85/month) ‚Üê NOT NEEDED
- Complex routing tables

Should be:
- VPC with public subnets only
- No NAT Gateways (follow YouWoAI pattern)
- Simple Internet Gateway routing
```

#### 2. Compute (ML Servers) ‚úÖ REASONABLE
```
Current:
- 2x t3.medium instances (4GB RAM, 2 vCPU each)
- Auto Scaling Group (2-4 instances)
- ~$67/month

Assessment: Appropriate for workload
```

#### 3. Database (PostgreSQL) ‚ö†Ô∏è SLIGHTLY OVERSIZED
```
Current:
- db.t3.medium (4GB RAM, 2 vCPU)
- 20GB storage (scales to 250GB)
- No Multi-AZ
- ~$85/month

Recommendation:
- Downsize to db.t3.small (2GB RAM)
- Saves $43/month
```

#### 4. Redis Cache ‚ùå NOT NEEDED
```
Current:
- ElastiCache Redis cluster
- cache.t3.micro
- ~$15/month

Question: Why do you need Redis?
- No session management (API tokens)
- No real-time features mentioned
- ML inference probably doesn't need caching

Recommendation: REMOVE ENTIRELY
```

#### 5. Load Balancer ‚úÖ REQUIRED
```
Current:
- Application Load Balancer
- HTTPS termination
- Health checks
- ~$30/month

Assessment: Required for HTTPS and scaling
```

## Cost Analysis

### Current Monthly Costs
| Component | Cost | Needed? |
|-----------|------|---------|
| EC2 Instances (2x) | $67 | ‚úÖ Yes |
| RDS PostgreSQL | $85 | ‚ö†Ô∏è Downsize |
| NAT Gateways (2x) | $85 | ‚ùå Remove |
| Redis Cache | $15 | ‚ùå Remove |
| ALB | $30 | ‚úÖ Yes |
| Storage/Logs | $20 | ‚úÖ Yes |
| **Total** | **$302** | |

### Optimized Costs
| Component | Cost | Change |
|-----------|------|--------|
| EC2 Instances (2x) | $67 | No change |
| RDS PostgreSQL (small) | $42 | -$43 |
| ~~NAT Gateways~~ | $0 | -$85 |
| ~~Redis Cache~~ | $0 | -$15 |
| ALB | $30 | No change |
| Storage/Logs | $20 | No change |
| **Total** | **$159** | **-$143 (47% savings)** |

## Architecture Decisions

### 1. Do You Need Redis? ü§î
**Probably NOT**, unless you have:
- Session management (but you use API tokens)
- Real-time features (WebSocket connections)
- Heavy query caching needs
- Rate limiting requirements

**For ML API Server**:
- Model inference is CPU/Memory bound, not cache-friendly
- API tokens don't need session storage
- Database queries likely simple user lookups

### 2. Do You Need NAT Gateways? ‚ùå
**NO** - Follow YouWoAI pattern:
- Put EC2 in public subnets
- Use security groups for protection
- Save $85/month

### 3. Do You Need Multi-AZ RDS? ‚ùå
**NO** - For your scale:
- 300-400 requests is very light
- Single AZ is sufficient
- Can add later if needed

### 4. Do You Need CloudFront? ü§î
**Maybe** - Depends on:
- If serving static ML models ‚Üí YES
- If pure API calls ‚Üí Probably not
- For China latency ‚Üí Consider it

## Simplified Architecture

```
Internet ‚Üí Route53 ‚Üí ALB ‚Üí EC2 Instances ‚Üí RDS
                       ‚Üì
                    HTTPS
                  
No NAT, No Redis, Simple and Cost-Effective
```

## What Your ML Server Actually Needs

1. **PostgreSQL**: User data, API tokens, request logs
2. **EC2 Instances**: Run Python ML server
3. **ALB**: HTTPS termination, health checks
4. **SSM Parameters**: Store secrets

That's it! Everything else is optional complexity.

## Recommended Changes Priority

1. **Remove NAT Gateways** ‚Üí Save $85/month
2. **Remove Redis** ‚Üí Save $15/month  
3. **Downsize RDS** ‚Üí Save $43/month
4. **Skip CloudFront** ‚Üí Not needed for API

## Questions to Answer

1. **What caching do you actually need?**
   - If none, remove Redis
   - If some, consider in-memory caching in Python

2. **What's in your database?**
   - User accounts?
   - API usage tracking?
   - ML model metadata?

3. **How stateless is your API?**
   - Fully stateless ‚Üí No Redis needed
   - Needs sessions ‚Üí Maybe keep Redis

4. **What's your actual traffic pattern?**
   - Steady 300-400 concurrent?
   - Burst patterns?
   - Time zone concentrated?

## Final Recommendation

Start with the **bare minimum**:
- 2x t3.medium EC2
- 1x db.t3.small RDS  
- 1x ALB
- No NAT, No Redis

**Monthly cost: ~$159** (vs current $302)

Add complexity only when you need it!
